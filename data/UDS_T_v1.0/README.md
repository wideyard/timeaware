The file `time_eng_ud_v1.2_2015_10_30.tsv` corresponds to the data reported in Vashishtha et al. 2019. The file contains temporal relation annotations developed from the the [Universal Dependencies v1.2 dataset](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/releases/tag/r1.2). The document ids of the UDv1.2 sentences can be found in a [later version](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT/blob/master/en_ewt-ud-train.conllu). 


The column descriptions and values for `time_eng_ud_v1.2_2015_10_30.tsv` can be found below.

| Pred1.Duration | The duration label annotated for the first predicate. | see data |
| Pred2.Duration | The duration label annotated for the second predicate. | see data |
| Pred1.Beg | The annotated beginning point of the first predicate (in linear order). A value between 0 and 100| see data |
| Pred1.End | The annotated end point of the first predicate (in linear order). A value between 0 and 100 | see data |
| Pred2.Beg | The annotated beginning point of the second predicate (in linear order). A value between 0 and 100| see data |
| Pred2.End | The annotated end point of the second predicate (in linear order). A value between 0 and 100 | see data |
| Pred1.Duration.Confidence | How confident was the annotator in labelling the duration annotation for the first predicate | `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` |
| Pred2.Duration.Confidence | How confident was the annotator in labelling the duration annotation for the second predicate | `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` |
| Relation.Confidence | How confident was the annotator in labelling the beginning and end points of the first and the second predicate | `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` |

## Notes

As mentioned in the paper, we refer to the situation referred to by the predicate that comes first in linear order as e1 and the situation referred to by the predicate that comes second in linear order as e2. 

`Sentence1.ID` correponds to the file and sentence number of the situation e1, and `Sentence2.ID` correponds to the file and sentence number of the situation e2. 

Note that `Sentence1.ID` and `Sentence2.ID` are either going to be equal to each other or `Sentence2.ID` will be the next sentence after `Sentence1.ID` in a document. This is because we concatenate every two consecutive sentences in a document to capture inter-sentential temporal relations. See paper for more details.
